# Mini-Project-26
# 🎞️ Resize the Colored Video to 50% (Smaller) using OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to use Python and OpenCV to resize a colored video to 50% of its original dimensions. The script reads a video file, processes each frame, reduces its size, and saves the output as a new video.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)



## 🚀 How It Works

1. Load the input video using OpenCV.
2. Read each frame from the video.
3. Resize each frame to 50% of its original width and height.
4. Write the resized frames to a new output video file.
5. Save the output video.

## 🧾 Requirements

Install OpenCV if not already installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
python resize_video.py
